# BikeSharingRegression
Regression Models compared using PyCaret to see best performing model to predict bike rentals per hour
In this project Bike sharing Dataset was used which is about bike sharing systems that are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.  Bike Sharing Systems are becoming more popular and important these days due to traffic, environmental and health issues. Regression analysis was used on the bike sharing dataset to help understand at what time are the most bikes being rented. Through the use of PyCaret, different models were analyzed and the best model was selected by making use of PyCaret's compare models. Ultimately, Light Gradient Boosting Machine was selected as the best model and the performance resulted in %96 accuracy with unseen data predictions.
